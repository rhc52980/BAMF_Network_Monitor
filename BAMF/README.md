# BAMF — Basic ARP Monitoring Framework

A lightweight WatchYourLAN-style network monitor that runs on **Windows and
Linux** from the same codebase. Ping-sweeps your subnet, reads the ARP table,
tracks every MAC address it has ever seen in SQLite, flags unknown hosts, fires
a webhook when something new appears, and serves a web dashboard.

It installs as a Windows Service or a systemd unit (and runs fine from a
console on either), with the same database format, the same dashboard, and the
same features on both. Popular homes for it: a Windows Server box, or a Debian
LXC container on Proxmox.

## How it works

Every scan cycle (default 60 s) the service:

1. Pings every address in the subnet in parallel (populates the ARP cache).
2. Reads the system ARP table (`arp -a` on Windows, `/proc/net/arp` on Linux)
   and keeps complete/dynamic entries in the subnet.
3. Resolves hostnames via reverse DNS and vendors via OUI prefix lookup.
4. Upserts each host into `bamf.db`. A never-before-seen MAC is stored as
   **unknown** and triggers the webhook (if configured).
5. Hosts not seen this cycle are marked offline.

The dashboard at `http://<server>:8840` polls `/api/hosts` every 10 seconds.

## Requirements

- **Windows**: Server 2022 (also fine on Win 10/11 and Server 2019).
- **Linux**: any Debian-based distro (Debian 12 / Ubuntu 22.04+), bare metal,
  VM, or LXC container.
- .NET 8 SDK to build (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
  — the published output can be fully self-contained, so the *server* needs
  nothing installed if you publish that way.
- Optional, for active ARP scanning: Npcap on Windows, libpcap on Linux.

## Install

- **Windows** — build (below), then register the service; the `update/` folder
  has a one-click updater and a desktop shortcut installer. See
  [Install as a Windows Service](#install-as-a-windows-service).
- **Linux** — `linux/install.sh` handles install *and* updates end to end
  (dependencies, build to `/opt/bamf`, systemd unit, start). For Proxmox LXC
  specifics see `linux/README-PROXMOX.md`.

## Build

From this folder:

```powershell
# Framework-dependent (needs the .NET 8 runtime on the server):
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish

# OR fully self-contained single file (no runtime needed on the server):
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64   -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -o publish   # Windows
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -o publish   # Linux
```

> **Rebuilding over a folder you already run from?** `dotnet publish` overwrites
> `appsettings.json` in the output folder — the build's copy always wins. Your
> `bamf.db` is safe (it isn't a build artifact), but your config is not. Copy it
> aside first and put it back after, or use the updaters below, which handle
> this for you.

## Run it manually first

```powershell
# Windows
cd publish; .\BAMF.exe
```

```bash
# Linux
cd publish && ./BAMF
```

Then open http://localhost:8840. Run it from a console at least once so you can
watch the log output and confirm the subnet detection and scan look right.

## Configuration (`appsettings.json`)

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Urls` | Listen address. Default `http://0.0.0.0:8840` (all interfaces). |
| `Bamf:Subnets` | List of CIDRs to scan, e.g. `["192.168.1.0/24", "192.168.2.0/24"]`. Empty list = auto-detect every active IPv4 interface. (`Bamf:Subnet` as a single string still works for back-compat.) |
| `Bamf:HistoryRetentionDays` | Days of online/offline history to keep (default 90, pruned daily). |
| `Bamf:AutoDownloadOui` | Download the IEEE vendor registry on first run (default true). |
| `Bamf:ActiveArpScan` | Use raw ARP scanning via Npcap/libpcap when available; falls back to ping sweep otherwise. |
| `Bamf:ScanIntervalSeconds` | Seconds between scans. |
| `Bamf:AutoIgnoreRandomizedMacs` | Auto-ignore new hosts with randomized MACs (default in shipped config: true). |
| `Bamf:WebhookUrl` | Optional. POSTs when a new host appears. Discord webhook URLs get rich embeds automatically (amber alert cards with MAC/IP/vendor/network); other endpoints get generic JSON with a `content` field. Use the dashboard's Test webhook button to verify. |
| `Bamf:Password` | Optional. If set, the UI/API require it via HTTP Basic auth (any username). |
| `Bamf:DatabasePath` | SQLite file, relative to the exe. |

## Active ARP scanning (optional, recommended)

With `ActiveArpScan` enabled (default in shipped config), BAMF sends raw ARP
requests to every address instead of relying on ping - catching devices whose
firewalls drop ICMP. This needs a packet-capture driver:

- **Windows** — install the free **Npcap** from https://npcap.com (defaults are
  fine), then restart the BAMF service.
- **Linux** — install `libpcap` (`linux/install.sh` does this for you) and make
  sure the service can open raw sockets; the shipped systemd unit grants
  `CAP_NET_RAW`/`CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

There's also a toggle switch in the dashboard header - flip it anytime and the
new mode applies from the next scan cycle. The dashboard toggle is stored in
the database and overrides the `ActiveArpScan` value in appsettings.json.

The "Last scan" card shows which mode ran (`active ARP` or `ping sweep`), and
each network tab's tooltip shows its mode. If the capture driver is missing or
a raw scan fails, BAMF logs a warning and automatically falls back to ping
sweep - nothing breaks.

Windows note: if you chose "Restrict Npcap driver's access to Administrators only"
during install, the service account needs admin rights - either reinstall Npcap
without that option, or run the service as LocalSystem (recreate it without the
`obj=` argument).

## Vendor names

On first run BAMF downloads the full IEEE vendor registry automatically in the
background (set `AutoDownloadOui` to false to stay offline) and saves it as
`oui.csv` next to the exe. Until the download completes, a small built-in table
covers common vendors; full names fill in on the next scan. You can also place
`oui.csv` there manually (https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.csv).

## Mobile

Under ~700px wide the device table reflows into a card layout — one card per
device with labeled fields — so it's usable one-handed on a phone without
horizontal scrolling. The who's-home board and everything else adapt too.

## Notes

Open a host's History panel to find a **Notes** field — free text for
remembering what a device is ("garage ESP32 sensor", "kids' iPad, bedtime 9pm").
A 📝 appears next to the name when a note exists (hover to preview), and notes
are included in search. Like custom names, notes are bound to the MAC and
survive IP changes.

## Fun extras

- **24h sparkline** - each row shows a tiny bar strip of the host's online/offline
  pattern over the last day, built from event history.
- **Who's home board** - a tab showing your watched devices as presence tiles
  (green = home/online, grey = away/offline). Great for people-devices.
- **17 themes** - click the theme button for a picker: Dark, Light, Terminal,
  Amber CRT, Synthwave, Commodore 64, Game Boy, Nord, Dracula, Solarized (dark
  + light), Gruvbox, High Contrast, Matrix, Blueprint, Hacker Red, Cotton Candy.
  CRT themes get scanlines; each pick triggers a BAMF! splat. Choice persists.

## Theme

A sun/moon button in the header toggles light and dark mode - and yes, every
flip triggers a 1960s-Batman-style comic splat (BAMF!, POW!, ZAP!...). The
choice persists across reloads. Respects prefers-reduced-motion.

## Desktop shortcut (Windows)

Run `update\Install-DesktopIcon.bat` once. It puts a **BAMF** shortcut on your
Desktop with the burst icon; double-clicking it opens the dashboard, silently
starting the service first if it isn't running (no admin prompt when the
service is already up). The launcher and icon are copied to `C:\BAMFApp`, so
the shortcut survives updates.

## What an update preserves

Both updaters are built so an update never costs you anything. Your settings
live in three places, and it helps to know which is which:

| What | Where it lives | On update |
|---|---|---|
| Subnets, password, webhook URL, scan interval, ping tuning | `appsettings.json` | Copied aside and restored. The version's fresh defaults are written next to it as `appsettings.new.json` so you can merge in any new options. |
| Custom names, notes, watch stars, ignored/known flags, all online-offline history, **and the dashboard's active-ARP and auto-ignore toggles** | `bamf.db` | Never touched, and snapshotted to `backups/` first (last 10 kept). |
| Theme choice | your browser's localStorage | Not on the server at all, so nothing can disturb it. |

The second row is the one people don't expect: the header toggles are stored in
the database, not the config file, and the database value **overrides**
`appsettings.json`. So if a toggle seems to ignore your config after an update,
that's why - flip it in the dashboard.

### Rolling back

The snapshots in `backups/` are ordinary SQLite files - restoring one is a copy:

```powershell
# Windows
Stop-Service BAMF
Copy-Item C:\BAMFApp\backups\bamf-20260808-231500.db C:\BAMFApp\bamf.db -Force
Start-Service BAMF
```

```bash
# Linux
systemctl stop bamf
cp /opt/bamf/backups/bamf-20260808-231500.db /opt/bamf/bamf.db
systemctl start bamf
```

To roll the *config* back instead, your previous `appsettings.json` is the one
still in place - it's `appsettings.new.json` that holds the incoming defaults.

## One-click updates (Windows)

On Linux, updating is the same one command as installing:
`bash /opt/bamf/install.sh /root/BAMF.zip` — it preserves your config and
database and snapshots the DB into `/opt/bamf/backups` first.

The `update` folder contains `Update-BAMF.bat` + `update.ps1`. One-time setup:
copy both files somewhere permanent (the Desktop is fine). The updater builds
from the zip via a temp folder, so the only folder BAMF keeps on disk is
`C:\BAMFApp` - app, config, database, and backups all live there. An old
`C:\BAMF` source folder from earlier versions is no longer used and can be
deleted.

From then on, updating is:

1. Download the new `BAMF.zip` (to Downloads).
2. Double-click `Update-BAMF.bat`. It elevates, stops the service, swaps the
   source, rebuilds, restores your `appsettings.json`, and restarts the service.
3. Ctrl+F5 the dashboard.

Your database and dashboard settings are never touched, and every update
snapshots `bamf.db` into `C:\BAMFApp\backups` first (last 10 kept). If an update ships new
config options, the fresh defaults are saved as `appsettings.new.json` next to
your kept config so you can merge anything interesting.

## Install as a Windows Service

Copy the `publish` folder somewhere permanent, e.g. `C:\BAMF`, then in an
elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
sc.exe create BAMF binPath= "C:\BAMF\BAMF.exe" start= auto obj= "NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"
sc.exe description BAMF "LAN host discovery and monitoring"
sc.exe start BAMF
```

Notes:
- `LocalService` is a low-privilege account and is sufficient: ping, `arp -a`,
  and DNS all work without admin rights. If you hit permission issues writing
  the database, grant that account modify rights on `C:\BAMF`, or run as
  `LocalSystem` (remove the `obj=` argument).
- Logs go to the Windows Event Log (source: BAMF / .NET Runtime) when
  running as a service.

Open the firewall so other machines can reach the dashboard:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "BAMF UI" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8840 -Action Allow
```

Uninstall:

```powershell
sc.exe stop BAMF
sc.exe delete BAMF
```

## Install as a systemd service (Linux)

`linux/install.sh` does the whole job as root — installs libpcap and the .NET 8
SDK (one-time), builds a self-contained binary to `/opt/bamf`, installs
`linux/bamf.service`, enables it, and starts it:

```bash
bash linux/install.sh              # from inside the source tree
bash linux/install.sh /root/BAMF.zip   # or straight from the zip
```

Notes:
- Everything lives in `/opt/bamf` — binary, `appsettings.json`, `bamf.db`, and
  `backups/`. Re-running the script updates in place and keeps all of it: your
  `appsettings.json` is restored afterwards (the version's fresh defaults are
  left as `appsettings.new.json`) and the database is snapshotted into
  `/opt/bamf/backups` first. See [What an update preserves](#what-an-update-preserves).
- The unit runs as `root` with `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_RAW CAP_NET_ADMIN`
  so active ARP scanning works.
- Logs: `journalctl -u bamf -f`. Control: `systemctl {status,restart,stop} bamf`.
- If a firewall is in the way, open TCP 8840 (e.g. `ufw allow 8840/tcp`).

Uninstall:

```bash
systemctl disable --now bamf && rm /etc/systemd/system/bamf.service && systemctl daemon-reload && rm -rf /opt/bamf
```

## Device links and port check

Each host's IP is a link that opens `http://<ip>` in a new tab - handy for
routers, NAS boxes, printers, and cameras with web UIs. The **Ports** button
runs an on-demand check of ~18 common service ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, SMB,
RDP, print, Plex, etc.) for that one host and shows what's open; web ports
become clickable links with the right scheme.

Three ways to scan:
- **Per host, common ports** - click **Ports** on a host row.
- **Per host, custom ports** - **Shift+click** Ports and enter a spec like
  `22,80,443,8000-8100`.
- **Network-wide** - the **Scan ports** button above the table opens a dialog:
  choose all online hosts or one network, common or custom ports.

All on-demand, never automatic. Single ranges are capped at 2000 ports and
host concurrency is bounded, so a scan can't turn into a network flood.

Results open in a **dockable panel** on the right that stays until you close
it, and keeps a log of every scan you run (newest on top) so you can compare
hosts. Web ports are clickable links. The panel is never wiped by auto-refresh.

## Down alerts (watch)

Click the ☆ **star** on any host to watch it. Watched hosts fire a Discord
alert when they go offline (red card) and again when they recover (green card,
with how long they were down). Ideal for a NAS, cameras, or a server you want
to know about the moment they drop. Requires `WebhookUrl` to be set. Watching
is stored per host (survives restarts) and is independent of known/ignored.

## Wake-on-LAN

Offline hosts get a **Wake** button that broadcasts a WoL magic packet (to the
global broadcast and the device's subnet directed-broadcast). For it to work:
the target must have Wake-on-LAN enabled in its BIOS/UEFI and OS network
adapter settings, and the BAMF server must have an interface on the target's
subnet (magic packets are layer-2 broadcasts and don't route). Give a woken
device a minute to boot; it'll flip to online on the next scan.

## Multi-network setups

BAMF discovers hosts via ARP, which is layer-2 and does not route between
subnets. To watch multiple networks the server needs an interface on each one
(e.g. one `netX` per subnet on a Proxmox LXC). BAMF binds its discovery probes
to the correct local interface per subnet, so a multi-homed host scans every
network on every cycle. If a subnet in your config has no matching local
interface, the log warns you and that subnet's hosts will appear offline.

## Limitations to be aware of

- ARP only sees the L2 segment the server sits on. Hosts on other VLANs are
  invisible unless the server has an interface on that segment and it's listed
  in `Subnets`. The dashboard's network switcher shows each configured network
  separately.
- Hostnames come from reverse DNS first, then a NetBIOS query (UDP 137) as a
  fallback - this names many Windows PCs, NAS boxes, and printers that have no
  DNS record. Devices that answer neither (lots of IoT gear, phones, some smart
  TVs) still show "-"; name those by hand, and the name sticks to the MAC.
- Phones with MAC randomization appear as new "(randomized MAC)" hosts each
  time they rejoin. With auto-ignore enabled (default; toggle in the
  dashboard header or via `AutoIgnoreRandomizedMacs`), these are auto-filed
  under the Ignored tab and never alert. You can also manually
  Ignore/Unignore any host from the dashboard.
- In ping-sweep mode, hosts that neither answer ping nor talk on the network
  during a cycle may briefly show offline even if powered on. Enable
  `ActiveArpScan` + install Npcap to catch these.
